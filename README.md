# Bitcoin Node Hub

Bitcoin Node Hub is an open-source application designed to help users monitor and view detailed information about multiple Bitcoin nodes. This is particularly useful for managing low-power, headless nodes that lack a dedicated monitor. Key features include real-time blockchain info (blocks, headers, size on disk, and pruned status), connection details (total connections, in/out ratios), and node version information.

## Dev Notes

VSCode sandboxing will not allow Node.js to call IPs that are on the local network. Either use external Terminal: Explorer Kind, or start vsCode with no sandboxing, or start the app outside of VSCode in a terminal window.
